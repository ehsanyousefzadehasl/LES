# Episode 1
- Our true wealth is our time and freedom. Money is just a tool for trading our time.
- The best investment that everyone can make in his lifetime is his own education. Education on the history of money. Education on finance. Education on how the global economy works. Education on how the central bankers, the stock market etc. can cheat us, how they can scam us.
- **Winston Churchill**: "The further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future."
- The way the monetary system works is something that isn't actually hidden away from all of us. It's out in the open, but it's complex and people just don't, they can't see how it works. It's hard for them to imagine that we're living in such a **hoax**.
- Roughly 5,000 years ago, the Egyptian started using gold and silver as their **predominant** from of currency, but it was not yet money. The pieces of gold and silver that they were using were odd sizes and weights. Odd purities. So, it still was not interchangable where each unit is the same as the next. This meant that nothing really had a price yet. They couldn't put a price of so many coins on something because they didn't have coins yet. Trade was still difficult. It was a kind of guessing game when it came to exchange the values.
- **The difference between currency and money**: Money must be a store of value and maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time.
- In fact, national currencies are really a tool used by the government and the financial sector to **leach away** your time and you freedom by stealing your purchasing power. So, rather than storing our economic energy, currencies leak.
- Gold is only formed when a star explodes, a supernova, and it stays around forever. This is one of the properties that makes it the ultimate money.
- Governments dislike gold because they fear the gold constrain their ability to spend beyond its means.
- **Inflation** is an expansion of the currency supply. If the currency supply is increased, the prices will rise.
- **Deflation** is a contraction of the currency supply. Prices will fall when the currency supply is decreased.
- But, in fact nothing happens in real world, prices don't rise. The only true phenomenon is that the currency goes down.
