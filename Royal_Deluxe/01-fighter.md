- Come back to life
- With a fire inside
- The fever is breaking
- The shadows are fading
- Away as I sharpen the knife
- Can't take me out
- No I ain't going down tonight (Ain't going down tonight)

- Not over yet, no
- Ain't gonna quit, no
- No matter what, no
- Never lay down, never give up

- I am a fighter, I'm a fighter, I'm a survivor
- Even if I fall, I'll be up again cause I'm a fighter
- I am a fighter, I'm a survivor
- Never lay down, never give up
- I am a fighter

- Under attack
- Sky's going black
- Sirens are sounding
- I'm screaming, I'm shouting
- I'm breaking the silence at last
- This is my life
- And I'm coming to take it back (Coming to take it back)

- Not over yet, no
- Ain't gonna quit, no
- No matter what, no
- Never lay down, never give up

- I am a fighter, I'm a fighter, I'm a survivor
- Even if I fall, I'll be up again cause I'm a fighter
- I am a fighter, I'm a survivor
- Never lay down, never give up
- I am a fighter

- Fighter, fighter, fighter, fighter
- Fighter, I'm a fighter, Fighter, I'm a fighter
- Fighter, I'm a fighter
- Never lay down, never give up, up, up, up

- I am a fighter, I'm a fighter, I'm a survivor
- Even if I fall, I'll be up again cause I'm a fighter
- I am a fighter, I'm a survivor
- Never lay down, never give up
- I am a fighter, I am a fighter
- Yeah I'm a fighter, I am a fighter
