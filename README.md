## My Favorite songs + their lyrics + new words from them

Best source of learning English and looking natural is learning English from natives and trying to live with the language, not just by reading books and trying to memorize grammar and vocabulary tips. Here, I collected what I liked most about songs, I tried to sing with them, and learn new words from them, and also improve my pronunciation.
