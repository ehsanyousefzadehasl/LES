- Do we make sense, I think we do
- In spite of everything that we've been through
- Oh and you say black and I say white
- It's not about who's wrong
- As long as it feels right
- Don't think those stars won't align
- Under your scars I pray
- You're like a shooting star in the rain
- You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah
- Under your scars, I could live inside you time after time
- If you'd only let me live inside of mine
- Live inside of mine
- Wish you were here
- Right beside me
- So I could watch you sleep
- Hold your body closer, breathe you deep
- And everything feels broken
- When you're not next to me
- Would you still be you
- If we weren't we
- Under your scars I pray
- You're like a shooting star in the rain
- You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah
- Under your scars, I could live inside you time after time
- If you'd only let me live inside of mine
- So hey, if you feel like coming down
- If you feel like coming around
- Just call my name out loud, na, na, na
- Hey, if you feel like coming down
- If you feel like coming around
- Just call my name out loud, na, na, na, yeah
- Under your scars I pray
- You're like a shooting star in the rain
- You're everything that feels like home to me, yeah
- Under your scars, I could live inside you time after time
- If you'd only let me live inside of mine
- Live inside of mine
