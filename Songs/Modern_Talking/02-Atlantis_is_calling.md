- Lady, I know it will hurt you
- But it's much harder to ignore
- There is a chance and I promise
- I won't hurt you anymore
- Hollywood nights, we're romancin'
- You can trust me anytime
- Somewhere, oh babe, there is someone
- Oh, you're dancin' in my mind
- Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
- I'm your fool, come on
- Teach me the rules
- I will send an S.O.S. for love
- Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
- I'm your fool, you need love
- Like I do
- I will send an S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling from the stars above
- Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
- If loving you is wrong, babe
- Oh, I don't wanna be right
- I've got you under my skin, babe
- Oh, baby, hold me tight
- I'm ready for our romance
- I wait a million years for you
- I love you more than I'm sayin'
- Baby, that's for me the truth
- Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
- I'm your fool, come on
- Teach me the rules
- I will send an S.O.S. for love
- Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
- I'm your fool, you need love
- Like I do
- I will send an S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling from the stars above
- Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
- Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
- I'm your fool, come on
- Teach me the rules
- I will send an S.O.S. for love
- Oh, oh, oh, little queenie
- I'm your fool, you need love
- Like I do
- I will send an S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling from the stars above
- Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
- Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
