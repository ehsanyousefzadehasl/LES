- Take me down to the river bend
- Take me down to the fighting end
- Wash the poison from off my skin
- Show me how to be whole again
- Fly me up on a silver wing
- Past the black where the sirens sing
- Warm me up in a **nova**'s **glow**
- And drop me down to the dream below
- 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
- Hardly anything there for you to see
- For you to see
- Bring me home in a blinding dream
- Through the secrets that I have seen
- Wash the sorrow from off my skin
- Show me how to be whole again
- 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
- Hardly anything there for you to see
- For you to see
- 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
- Hardly anything else I need to be
- 'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
- Hardly anything there for you to see
- For you to see
- For you to see
