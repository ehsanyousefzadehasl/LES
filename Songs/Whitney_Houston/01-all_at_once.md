- All at once
- I finally **took a moment**
- And I'm realizing that
- You're not coming back
- And **it finally hit me**
- All at once
- All at once
- I started counting teardrops
- And at least a million fell
- My eyes began to **swell**
- And all my dreams were
- **Shattered** all at once
- Ever since I met you
- You're the only love I've known
- And I can't forget you
- Though I must face it all alone
- All at once
- I'm drifting on a lonely sea
- Wishing you'd come back to me
- And that's all that matters now
- All at once
- I'm drifting on a lonely sea
- Holding on to memories
- And it hurts me more than you know
- So much more than it shows
- All at once
- All at once
- I looked around and found
- That you were with another love
- In someone else's arms
- And all my dreams were shattered
- All at once
- All at once
- The smile that used to greet me
- Brightened someone else's day
- She took your smile away
- And left me with just memories
- All at once
- Ever since I met you
- You're the only love I've known
- And I can't forget you
- Though I must face it all alone
- All at once
- I'm drifting on a lonely sea
- Wishing you'd come back to me
- And that's all the matters now
- All at once
- I'm drifting on a lonely-sea
- Holding on to memories
- And it hurts me more than you know
- So much more than it shows
- All at once
- All at once
- I'm drifting on a lonely sea
- Wishing you'd come back to me
- And it hurts me more than you know
- So much more than it shows
- All at once
- And that's all the matters now
- All at once
- I'm drifting on a lonely sea
- Wishing you'd come back to me
- And it hurts me more than you know
- All at once
