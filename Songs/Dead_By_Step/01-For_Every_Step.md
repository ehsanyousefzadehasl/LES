Looking back at yesterday
Now there's nothing else missing, no
The puzzle **is closed incomplete**
And I've never felt so old
And **I will never leave your side**
For every step I will be there for you, for us
And every second for the rest of my life you will find me here
You will find me here
My heart is in your hands
A bomb so unbreakable
I have never felt like this before
I never knew it was possible
Never knew I was capable
You gonna never break a bond like this
And I will never leave your side
For every step I will be there for you, for us
And every second for the rest of my life you will find me here
I'm following you, I'm following you
I'm following you **'till the end**
I'm **standing by you**, I'm standing by you
I will be standing by you 'till the end
I'm following you, I'm following you
I'm following you, I'm following you
For every step I will be there for you, for us
And every second for the rest of my life you will find me here
You will find me here
