- Killing me, killing me, killing me slowly
- I built these walls to hide my ghosts
- Your fingers trace the wounds exposed
- I try and try to let you in
- But I fail again and again
- So I keep you at arm's length and let you go
- But I don't wanna give you away
- Yeah, I keep you at arm's length and let you go
- But only if you promise to stay
- You think you know that you know, but you really don't know me
- I know you love so hard, and it's killing me slowly
- And now I can't eat, can't sleep, knowing that you're not lonely
- I know you love so hard, and it's killing me slowly
- Killing me, killing me, killing me slowly
- I run this maze, erase my steps
- With lips that lie, with every breath
- You try and try to let me in
- But I hurt you again and again
- So I keep you at arm's length and let you go
- But I don't wanna give you away
- Yeah, I keep you at arm's length and let you go
- But only if you promise to stay
- You think you know that you know, but you really don't know me
- I know you love so hard, and it's killing me slowly
- And now I can't eat, can't sleep, knowing that you're not lonely
- I know you love so hard, and it's killing me slowly, killing me slowly
- You are everything I need, I should've known, I should've known
- You are everything I need, I should've known
- You are everything I need, I should've known, I should've known
- You are everything I need, I should've known
- You think you know that you know, but you really don't know me
- I know you love so hard, and it's killing me slowly
- And now I can't eat, can't sleep, knowing that you're not lonely
- I know you love so hard, and it's killing me slowly
- You are everything I need, I should've known
- Killing me, killing me, killing me slowly
- You are everything I need, I should've known
- Killing me, killing me, killing me slowly
