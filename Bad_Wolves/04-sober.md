- For a moment I can wait
- It's a fight I guess I'll never know
- For a moment I can wait
- I'm holding on to hope
- And I know you're stoned, I can see it
- The struggle's getting old
- For a moment I can wait

- 'Cause you said you're **sober**
- Lying and I can't get closer
- Tell me should I let you go?
- Tell me should I let you go?
- 'Cause you said you're sober
- Lying and I can't get closer
- Tell me should I let you go?
- Tell me should I let you go?

- Every moment I'm awake
- It's a fight that you could never know
- Every moment I'm awake
- I'm clinging on to hope
- And I feel so low but I'm dealing
- The struggle's getting old
- Every moment I'm awake

- But I'm getting sober
- Trying but I can't get closer
- Baby did you let me go?
- Baby did you let me go?
- Now I'm getting sober
- Trying but I can't get closer
- Baby did you let me go?
-Baby did you let me go?
