- When it was 1992
- Two little kids stealing records, **skipping school**
- We must have been like only ten
- **Taking life for granted** 'til we learned it had an end
(Remember when)
- Time is something they say
- You never appreciate till you age
- Until this day you never knew
- I wanted to be just like you
- If I only knew
- Then what I know now
- Then what I know now
- If I only knew
- Then what I know now
- Then what I know now
- When it was 2002
- You started **slinging** **coke** and got the **dopest** pair of shoes
- We owe this house a state of home
- Since our father **hit the bottle** and our mother **hit the road**
- Time is something they say
- You never understand until it **slips away**
- And looking back I think you knew
- I wanted to be just like you
- If I only knew
- Then what I know now
- Then what I know now
- If I only knew
- Then what I know now
- Then what I know now
- And now I'm tired of the violence
- I'm so tired of the silence
- And it's better me, better me than you
- Now I'm tired of the violence
- I'm so tired of the silence
- And it's better me, better me than you
- Slipping and we're falling
- We're falling through ice
- Slipping and we're falling
- Don't know where we're going with our lives
- If I only knew
- Then what I know now
- Then what I know now
- If I only knew
- Then what I know now
- Then what I know now
- Now I'm tired of the violence
- I'm so tired of the silence
- And it's better me, better me than you
- Now I'm tired of the violence
- I'm so tired of the silence
- And it's better me, better me than you
- slipping and we're falling
- We're falling through ice
- Slipping and we're falling
- Don't know where we're going with our lives
- Slipping and we're falling
- And we're falling through ice
