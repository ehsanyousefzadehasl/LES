- I can barely hear a sound, it's faded
- All the words you used to say
- Tried to keep me down, I'm elevated
- No more rain on this parade
- I went deep inside, where monsters hide
- To free my mind, and come out alive
- Tell me when you kicked me did you ever think that I would get up?
- Can you hear me now so loudly?
- I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
- Can you see me now so proudly?
- Looking up at what I've become
- Can you hear me now, up above the crowd?
- Singing whoa, whoa
- Can you hear me now so loudly?
- Can you hear me, can you hear me now?
- Tried to find the light between your shadows
- But it always seemed to fade
- It took me time for me to learn to let go
- But I grew stronger from the pain
- I went deep inside, where monsters hide
- To free my mind, and come out alive
- Tell me when you kicked me did you ever think that I would get up?
- Can you hear me now so loudly?
- I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
- Can you see me now so proudly?
- Looking up at what I've become
- Can you hear me now, up above the crowd?
- Singing whoa, whoa
- Can you hear me now so loudly?
- Can you hear me, can you hear me now?
- I went deep inside, where monsters hide
- To free my mind, and come out alive
- Tell me when you kicked me did you ever think that I would get up?
- Can you hear me now so loudly?
- I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
- Can you see me now so proudly?
- Looking up at what I've become
- Can you hear me now, up above the crowd?
- Singing whoa, whoa
- Can you hear me now so loudly?
- Can you hear me, can you hear me now?
- Can you hear me, can you hear me now?
