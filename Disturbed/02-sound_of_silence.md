- Hello darkness, my old friend
- I've come to talk with you again
- Because a vision softly creeping
- Left its seeds while I was sleeping
- And the vision that was planted in my brain
- Still remains
- Within the sound of silence
- In restless dreams I walked alone
- Narrow streets of cobblestone
- 'Neath the **halo** of a street lamp
- I turned my **collar** to the cold and damp
- When my eyes were **stabbed** by the flash of a neon light
- That **split** the night
- And touched the sound of silence
- And in the **naked light**, I saw
- Ten thousand people, maybe more
- People talking without speaking
- People hearing without listening
- People writing songs that voices never share
- And no one dared
- Disturb the sound of silence
- "Fools", said I, "You do not know
- Silence like a cancer grows
- Hear my words that I might teach you
- Take my arms that I might reach you"
- But my words, like silent raindrops fell
- And echoed
- In the wells of silence
- And the people **bowed** and prayed
- To the neon god they made
- And the sign flashed out its warning
- In the words that it was forming
- And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
- And **tenement** halls"
- And whispered in the sound of silence
