- Don't let me go, little darling
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling
- Don't let me go, little darling
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling
- A lonely avenue, it's raining in my heart
- Where is your number girl, how can I try a start without you?
- I'm lonely as a cloud, oh, when your love falls down
- You make the sun keep shining, oh, when you're just around
- And whenever will be, I promise your love, forever my love
- Don't let me go, little darling
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling
- Don't let me go, little darling
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling
- That I'm so in love with you
- When the sun goes down, the world is in your hands
- To the clouds we fly, to the rainbows end
- You, and I
- Only my shadow knows love is on my side
- I'll fly around the moon just to hold you tight, Only You
- And whenever will be, I promise your love, forever my love
- Don't let me go, little darling
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling
- Don't let me go, little darling
- Oh, no-no-no-no-no little darling
- That I'm so in love with you
